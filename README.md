# Url Shortener
This project is a Url shortener. It's possible to send a url and the endpoint will return with a very short url, and then when you go to the shortened url you are redirected to the original url. </br>
I also implemented a click count for each link to track how many times the shortened link has been used. </br> </br>
The main tecnologies used are:
* Java
* Spring boot for the API
* Docker
* Traefik for reverse proxying
